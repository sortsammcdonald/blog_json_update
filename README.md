# Overview

This is an update of an earlier project I worked on [link](https://github.com/sortsammcdonald/md_json{). As with my previous iteration, this programme is designed to convert markdown blog files I post my [blog](www.ql-blog.co) into a single JSON file. This file is intended for archiving, training LLMs, and for anyone who wants to easily modify my blog posts.
