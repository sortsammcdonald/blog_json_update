# Overview

Decided to look at this project again, my goal is to:
- Update the code to that to generate a JSON feed based on Squarespace blog post.
- Use the JSON feed to generate a RAG implementation for an LLM to answer questions relevant to to the topics.

In testing the programme works, I should be able to create a JSON file containing all my main blog's posts. 

Extracting the text from it is likely to be quite tedious, could be a low energy, annoying task to tackle during the holidays.

Looks like I will have to include meta-data similar to that used by Astro to format the JSON correctly.

I should take a sample blog, add the metadata, and test the programme to see if it works.

# 2024.12.17 

Need to remove functions related to Astro formatting
