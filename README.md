# Overview

This is an update of an earlier project I worked on [link](https://github.com/sortsammcdonald/md_json{). As with my previous iteration, this programme is designed to convert markdown blog files I post my [blog](www.ql-blog.co) into a single JSON file. In the first place, the programme reads the front matter present in all astro blog files and the content in the posts to generate a JSON file that combines all blog posts in a folder. There also options to append entries to existing JSON records and a funtction to check for duplicate entries in the JSON file.

This file is intended for archiving, training LLMs, and for anyone who wants to easily modify my blog posts.
